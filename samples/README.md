# Feature targeting samples

This set of samples should demonstrate the capabilities feature targeting
can provide.

## Getting started

- create a cluster and install Istio: [`init-cluster`](./1-init-cluster/README.md)
- enable the feature targeting Istio adapter [`2-enable-adapter`](./2-enable-adapter/README.md)

## Samples

- [Hello World](./hello-world/README.md) - A simple hello world that shows
  feature state injection happening with an Echo server.
